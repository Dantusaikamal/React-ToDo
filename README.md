# React ToDo list

This repository contains a To-do list app that I've created using React. The Todo app let's you add multiple tasks in order to execute multiple chats quickly. You can also delete them once you are done. Also the list can be divided into two parts: Finished tasks, Unfinished tasks. 

The tasks will automatically segrate into the finished list if you mark them completed.
You can view pending tasks in the unfinished tasks list.

Also, you can delete the tasks once you feel they're no longer important.<br>

## How to start:

1. Clone my repository or download the zip file
2. If you're downloading the zip file, extract the zip file to a folder
3. Make sure you installed Node package manager. If not download it from here:
 ```
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/download
```
4. Open the folder with a code editor like VS code or any IDE.
5. Open terminal in the editor and enter 'npm install' 
This will install all required dependencies in the node_modules. 
6. After installing node modules, enter 'npm start' to start the development server. Happy coding! :)
