# React-ToDo

This repository contains a To-do list app that I've created using React. The Todo app let's you add multiple tasks in order to execute multiple chats quickly. You can also delete them once you are done. Also the list can be divided into two parts: Finished tasks, Unfinished tasks. 

The tasks will automatically segrate into the finished list if you mark them completed.
You can view pending tasks in the unfinished tasks list.

Also, you can delete the tasks once you feel they're no longer important.

**Here's a preview of the application:**
